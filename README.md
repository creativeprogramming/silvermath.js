# equation.js

This will be a high-quality equation editor/renderer in JavaScript. To see the current version, please visit the [demo page](http://evanw.github.com/equation.js/).

## Goals

* Cross-platform
* Behaves as close to a regular textbox as possible
* Lightweight (just need one file on the server, no custom fonts or images)
* Modular system for storage formats (MathML/LaTeX) and render targets (Canvas/HTML)
